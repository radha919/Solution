The algorithm for finding the middle element in a singly linked list involves two pointers - a slow pointer and a fast pointer.
The slow pointer traverses the list one node at a time while the fast pointer traverses the list two nodes at a time.
This ensures that when the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer is at the middle node.

If the number of nodes in the linked list is even, there are two middle nodes - the one at the floor(n/2)th position and the one at the ceil(n/2)th position. 
In this case, the algorithm returns the second middle element.

To implement the algorithm, we start by initializing both the slow and fast pointers to the head of the linked list.
We then traverse the list using the fast pointer and update the slow pointer one node at a time.
When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer is at the middle node or the node before the middle node, 
depending on whether the number of nodes is odd or even.

int getMiddle(Node* head) {
    Node* slow = head;
    Node* fast = head;

    while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next->next;
    }

    return slow->data;
}

This function takes a reference to the head of the linked list as input and returns the data at the middle node.
If the linked list is empty, the function returns -1 (assuming that -1 is not a valid data value in the linked list).
