To find the index of the Current Index Member in the new changed queue, we need to know basic things as follows:

1. The current index value of the queue before the change.
2. The index value of the member that were removed from the queue.
3. The new order of the remaining members in the queue after the removal.
4. We can follow these steps to find the index of the Current Index Member in the new queue:

Subtract the number of removed members that had a lower index value than the current index value from the current index value.
For example, if the current index value was 5 and 2 members with index values of 3 and 4 were removed, the new current index value would be 5 - 2 = 3.
If the new current index value is greater than or equal to the size of the new queue, wrap it around to the beginning of the queue.
For example, if the new queue has 7 members and the new current index value is 8, it would wrap around to 1 (since the queue is circular).
If the new current index value is negative, wrap it around to the end of the queue. 
For example, if the new queue has 7 members and the new current index value is -1, it would wrap around to 7.
Once we have calculated the new current index value, we can use it to find the index of the Current Index Member in the new queue.
